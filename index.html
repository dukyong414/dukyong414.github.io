          <p>
            Hello everyone.<br>
            My name is Dukyong Kim, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University’s Evanston campus.
            I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea, where I earned both my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Hanyang University.
            As a passionate enthusiast of automobiles—from Hot Wheels to Formula One—I’ve long been fascinated by the mechanical behavior of cars.
            This curiosity led me to delve deeply into mechanical engineering, where I became captivated by the multifunctionality of lasers in manufacturing—not only in the automotive industry but
            also across aerospace, shipbuilding, and semiconductor sectors.
            During my undergraduate studies, I focused on laser-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes for my senior research project. Building on that foundation, I expanded my expertise into
            pulsed laser-induced shock wave testing, commonly known as the Laser Spallation Test, which is highly effective for quantifying the interfacial adhesion properties of thin films
            As I advance through my Ph.D. journey at Northwestern, I aim to collaborate with distinguished researchers and leverage cutting-edge experimental facilities to deepen my understanding of 
            laser–material interactions during AM processes. My goal is to identify and mitigate defect formation mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the global advancement and reliability of 
            next-generation manufacturing technologies.

            Laser Additive Manufacturing (AM) Process
          </div>
          <div class="project-desc">
            Metal AM process is an effective way in fabricating components that possess intricate shapes for aerospace or automobile applications, 
            which are challenging to make using conventional molding processes.
            Such intricate geometric-shaped metal components necessiate tiltment of laser nozzle or even inclined substrate angle (when performing DED process).
            However, such tiltment can induce irregular flow of the molten metal in inclined posture of the laser nozzle, thus degrading the deposition quality.
            Therefore, to solve this issue, I have built a guideline that enables AM industry workers to refer to when performing laser-DED process at extreme angles.
            My contribution in this guideline is that I have incorporated the effect of proccessing variables (such as laser power, laser beam diamter, etc.) into the guideline,
            which was not previously performed before.

            Laser Spallation Test (a pulse-laser induced shock wave test to quantify thin film's interfacial adhesion properties)
          </div>
          <div class="project-desc">
            Advanced packaging (AVP) process in the semiconductor industry have garnerd significant interest as a game-changer in enhancing the advanced microelectronic chips.
            In the background of the process, thin film featuring a thickness of few nanometers is required to necessiate micro connection routes inside the chips. However, these 
            thin film are prone to interfacial delamination due to their brittle nature during the AVP process (due to processes such as the dicing process or heat accumulation).
            Therefore, quantitively knowing the interfacial properties of these thin film is required, however conventional contact-type testing methods have limitations due to
            plastic deformation during the jigging process. The only method known to quantitively perform/acquire the thin film's interfacial property is the laser spallation test. 
            This is because the delamination energy source, which is the shock wave of GPa magnitude that is generated upon the impingment of the pulse laser, minimizes the plastic deformation owing t[...]
            its high strain rate behavior.
            Based on this previous literature study of the laser spallation test, I co-worked with SK Hynix to build the laser spallation system (consisting of a pulse laser for ablation and
            Michelson interferomter of subnanosecond-time region resolution) for the first time in South Korea. This allowed our reseach team to quantify various thin film material and structure.

          <div class="project-desc">
            Manufacturing processes require optimizations of processing variables to acquire high-quality products exhibiting exceptional Mechanical properties. 
            Even more, many processes also require predictions of the outcome, which can effectively reduce the waste and also decision-making time. 
            That said, the optimization and prediction process can be easily performed by utilizing Machine Learning models. Now however, the trend is to imply some physical meaning into the
            ML models. This is because the black-box type ML model lacks in generalization and also require high-cost experimental data to train the model (not to mention that
